Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Anisha B.,"On Valentine's morning at 9:45, I started walking towards the restaurant with my friend to go stand in the queue. I was visiting from California, and my manager at work had highly recommended that I go to this place - he even let me take the morning off to go stand in the queue! So cool! He told me that this is not the one to miss if you're in Seattle, and given that it was my first time in Seattle, I thought I wouldn't let go of the opportunity!
After reaching the restaurant at 10:20AM, we were the sixth ones in the queue. I highly (very highly!!) recommend getting there at least 30 (and ideally 40) minutes before their opening time of 11AM. We were able to enter inside as soon as it opened. Definitely follow them on instagram - yummy posts of their daily rotating pasta and the prep process will make your mouth water every morning! I could not get myself to unfollow them. I love seeing how they make their pasta and with what! On Valentine's, they made a reddish pink beet puree pasta for the love theme - how cute is that!
I don't need to talk much about their food because their Yelp ratings speak for themselves!! The kale salad, as boring as it gets for salad-haters otherwise, is a treat! Do not skip it! My not-so-into-salad friends gorged it completely. I loved their madaline sandwich cookie that they sell by the piece! Very buttery and melts in your mouth. Focaccia is to die for - looks like bread but dissolves in your mouth like the softest cake. Everything is super, super affordable! Pasta ~ $10-11 and appetizers ~ $4-5 apiece. Love this about them! Keeping their game strong by creating this demand for their product, but despite the demand, not shooting prices up - thanks, Il Corvo! We love your humility!
Il Corvo has now switched to 100% take-out in the light of COVID-19 outbreak. They are a dine-in only place, so I am sure Seattle-ites really appreciate their favorite restaurant staying connected to them by taking this step.
Il Corvo also has a sister (high-end) restaurant called Il-Nido, which I hear isn't as popular as this one, but I would love to try it when I am in Seattle next."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Hung V.,"Before Corvo Pasta, Ive only known T.V dinners and Cheesecake Factory ""pasta"". Therefore I did not like Corvo the very first time.
But since my first time, Ive learned to appreciate real pasta, and have developed a distaste for the garbage served at Cheesecake Factory and Olive Garden.
Corvo is AMAZING. Aside from my opinions, I've heard people mention that the pasta here is better than places in Rome. They have 1 main option thats served everyday (bolognese) and 2 rotating options. The bolognese is well deserving of non-rotation. And my favorites of the rotating options is the Rigatoni with cheese (im not sure which type, Sorry!) and spicy meat balls.
Almost everytime I come here, I get the kale salad. I did not like kale before coming here. Ill leave it at that.
The pasta is a deal here at 10.95 (previously 9.95). Portions may seem small, but its just an illusion. Each serving should be enough for an average eater.
Street Parking is a bit annoying to find and a tad expensive. But if you don't mind there is a public parking garage down the hill that charges 3 dollars per hour (street parking is $5/hour).
The biggest concern about eating here is the hours. Only open during weekdays from 11AM TO 3PM. And if you plan to come before 1:45 be prepared to wait in line. But thats the little secret with this restaurant. You can come at opening and wait 2 hours, or you can come around 2PM and skip the lines.
Overall, if you don't want to deal with the BS ""Fine Dining"" places that charge 20+ for some pasta, come to Corvo for some perfectly made, Al-dente pasta from an Award winning chef."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Young N.,"Holy smokes. This place is the real deal. While I don't consider myself an Italian food expert, I've been to Italy and have consumed my fair share of pasta. The food at Il Corvo measures up. No pictures as I gobbled up the food right as it served.
My friend and I ordered the Lasagna and the Pappardelle but started with their kale salad. The salad was a good appetizer before we loaded up on carbs. A little heavy on the dressing for me but not too bad and definitely fresh and aromatic. Generous portions too, enough for two.
The pastas though are what give this place 5/5, inconvenient hours and wait aside. Of the two we ordered, the Pappardelle was better but both dishes had the same amazing chewy, soft, fresh pasta texture. It stands out the instant you bite into it. They also come with lots of fresh Parmesan cheese on top. If you're coming solo and need to pick one, I give the slight edge to the Pappardelle. The sauce packs more of a punch, is meatier, and more complex. I definitely hope to go again."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Jina H.,"Fresh pasta and appetizers that compliment the dishes for a satisfying meal for a deal of 10.95 and change! Getting here early is the key because the wait time is due to the line and ordering because there is one kiosk station
Party of 2 waited starting 10:15am (first in line) and by 10:30 the line was almost to the end of the street. The two rotating pasta dishes are uploaded to Instagram before opening which is nice to see the daily options as the regular is a bolognese and doors promptly open on time
The line continues to move into the restaurant as you order at the counter- we got the lumache ""snail pasta"" that was in a turnip cream sauce and campanelli ""ruffled cone"" in a spring onion, tomato, arugula, and marjoram sauce. We also got appetizers of the kale salad, focaccia, and prosciutto. Before ordering, the staff was already plating various antipasti to serve and we got assigned a seat.
Tables are shared communally as the restaurant makes use of all the space. Utensils and water are self serve. Our antipasti was on our table before we even sat down and pasta showed up not even 5 minutes after.
Everything was fresh and made with love! The pastas were cooked perfectly and paired well with all three antipasti- especially the focaccia and kale salad. The salad was piled on in volume and the focaccia was soft and moist. Cured ham was a nice light pairing with the bread and even of its own with celery and oil. The lumache with turnip cream is one I am still thinking about and the campanelli had a hint of spice due to the arugula and marjoram.
With such fast service and turn around, we were done with our meal in half and hour and to go boxes available by the self serve station. Staff was around clearing plates, wiping down tables and checking everything consistently. Bus your own table and off you go. I can see myself coming multiple times a week to try the variety of pasta and pair it with various antipasti, the cookies look delicious too. Whether you try all three pastas or one at a time, you can't go wrong here. Definitely worth a trip when in Seattle"
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Korah L.,"After years of hearing my boyfriend talk about this place, I finally had the energy and time to head downtown to give it a try myself. And yeah, the hype is real -- for a few reasons. The wait is inevitable, but completely worth it. Took us about 45 minutes until we reached the counter but the way their seating/service is set up, there seems to always be seating available. This is so great because it means you get to enjoy your pasta super fresh without the hassle of waiting on people to leave!
Once we sat it only took about 5 minutes to be served our pastas and wow did it not disappoint. I'm not a huge al dente fan but I know this how traditional pasta is eaten and yeah, I might be addicted to pasta now. The food was just SO good. Difficult to put in words. They always have vegetarian options as well as their staple bolognese pappardelle so if you come with a group of people I'm sure everyone will find something to love here. The wait is worth it!"
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Cindy T.,"This was a unique experience but I think I would only do it once. You may disagree if you're a bigger fan of pasta.
We got here around10:30am on a Friday and there was already a line almost to the corner. Still had to wait about an hour and a half before we got to the register. Luckily, the food comes out really fast.
All the food was freshly plated. We had the prosciutto and house focaccia. They were both exactly as one would expect. The focaccia was baked with some kind of herb and was pretty good.
The pasta came out really hot. We were ambitious and had all 3 pasta choices: the Bolognese, Lasagna, and Campanelli. The bolognese was okay to me, a little salty for my preference. My friend thought the Campanelli was really good. I don't like mushrooms, so I avoided it. The Lasagna was actually really good. I had to finish it. It was hot, cheesy, and perfectly flavored.
After you're done eating, you bus your own tables which can be difficult because it's a very cramped and crowded space. Honestly, the food is good but it's such a long wait, you eat in a cramped area, you have to wiggle your way through the restaurant to bus your dishes...might not be worth it if you don't really love pasta. Not a place for the claustrophobic."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Wendy D.,"Came here at around 10:30am on a Friday, and there was already a line around the corner. I ended up waiting around 1.5 hours and was seated at 12. They have 3 pastas on the menu, 2 of which rotate daily. I ordered the beet fiore and house focaccia. The pasta was SO good. The main thing I take into consideration is flavor. The pasta sauce was so flavorful. It tasted super rich, and had a beautiful pink color.
The wait definitely was insane and it's hard to say if the food was worth the wait, but it's a must try at least once!"
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Preston M.,"Tl;dr great pasta, can be on the salty side depending on your taste. Would give 4.75 stars if possible.
Finally made it out to this legendary pasta shop. I've heard only excellent things so I was excited to try their changing menu of pasta dishes. I ordered a pasta dish with clams and a lemon sauce which looked incredible.
First the pasta itself; it's amazing and totally worth it just to experience that alone. Good pasta is hard to find and I haven't had such great flavor and texture since I've been to Italy.
The sauces and ingredients used here really seem like top quality ingredients. The flavors are strong and compliment the pasta quite well.
The only downsides: the dishes tend to be on the salty side, but that could just be because I'm used to a lower sodium diet? Idk but most of my friends also agree. Secondly you don't get a ton of food so plan accordingly. 10/10 would recommend"
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Jason L.,"I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!"
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Dione L.,"If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a line isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Victoria C.,"I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Phil H.,"Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Mandi W.,"I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Tina Z.,"We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Carol L.,"BEST PASTA EVER! I would definitely give this place more stars if it were possible.
There is a long line, but most good places in Seattle do. I started lining up at 10:30 AM and got seated by 11:30. They don't let you save seats so you order first and a waiter will both guide you to an assigned seat and deliver the food.
One of the coolest things about this place is that they change their pasta menu daily. They have a classic pasta, which is always on their menu, called the pappardelle and it's amazing. The pasta is cooked to al dente and the meat sauce covers every little inch of that pasta. I still salivate thinking about it. Their other two kinds of pasta change daily according to what seasonal or fresh ingredients come about. You can follow their Instagram to see what the chef decides to make. Honestly, all their pasta are great though so I highly recommend you try them all. I also recommend getting the focaccia bread and the kale salad. They might not be on the top of your list of foods to try, but I promise you won't regret it!
All in all, everything was great from the food to the service. It's worth the hype and the recognition it gets. I'm currently still looking for something similar in LA, but have yet to find it. Really hoping they open a restaurant down here, but also a little worried that I would eat there WAY too often if they actually did."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Rebecca B.,"I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Rachel Z.,"I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Rachel H.,"Finally was in the area around lunch to try this place out! Line wasn't too bad, as I came pretty late into the lunch hour.
I got the Bolognese and it was tasty! The texture of the sauce was a little soft for me, but the pasta itself was amazing. I would definitely come back to try some of their daily pasta's but not sure it totally lived up to they hype."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Lindsey S.,"The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes."
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,Mia C.,"For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sarah M.,"Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Dan T.,"We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Chris A.,"A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Heidi L.,"I was looking for a nice date night spot for my boyfriend and I since we were craving Italian food for our anniversary. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time we came in. The chef, himself stopped by our table asking how our food was, he then recommended a spicy oil that would go well with my special pasta. I love spicy food so that was a pleasant experience and it complimented the food well. Both the pasta dishes were filled with flavor and just danced in our taste pallet. It had us talking about it for the rest of the evening haha. I would definitely comeback for another date night!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jun Li Z.,"Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacey H.,"Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Michael G.,"Excellent all around.
We came on a Friday night. Many open tables, but they were committed to upcoming diners, so we were seated at the bar. Our good luck since we got to chat up many people behind the bar.
Interesting menu choices, tapas, full dishes, that start traditional Italian but also have a Spanish twist to many items.
We had veal marsala and vodka penne. The marsala was particularly adventurous. Great wine by the glass choices.
Tiramisu is a have-to-have. Eastlake should be proud to have this in their neighborhood!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,John W.,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Ken H.,"This is a treasured establishment that always delivers. It is and shall remain a Seattle favorite.
It is small and quaint and it fills up very quickly.
If you go, go when it opens because it will be full by the time you leave.
Spaghetti and Meatballs are amazing and the veal dishes are out of this world.
They also have a great Caesar salad that you can get the WHITE SPANISH ANCHOVIES with and its worth it.
Friendly, but not always warm and if busy, a feeling of being rushed.
Still, a great spot for good food."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Zachariah H.,"I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Prag R.,"Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Khanh N.,"I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nancy W.,"I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Danielle D.,"TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Janhavi B.,"My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Isaiah G.,A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenny C.,"Machiavelli is a good basic Italian place that is very popular with the locals. There is almost always a wait but we showed up after 8pm on the Saturday and only waited 20 minutes so that was reasonable. The server promptly brought us ice water and Columbia City bread. The bread was definitely fresh with a soft interior and a chewy crust. The dipping sauce is unique too and sold in bottles for $6.50. The wines by the glass were reasonably priced at $7.50-$8.50 per glass.
We ordered the Linguine alle Vongole $12.95 and the Fettucine Carbonara $13.95. My favorite was the linguine. The linguine had a very flavorful spicy garlic red sauce. On the other hand, the carbonara sauce lacked salt despite the bacon and the pasta was served lukewarm which detracted from our enjoyment of it. Oddly enough, the carbonara had a smaller portion size too compared to the linguine despite being the pricier entree.
Two options were available for dessert tonight: housemade tiramisu or vanilla cheesecake. We opted for the tiramisu and were not disappointed. The ladyfingers were soaked with the perfect amount of liquid and had a good coffee flavor without being soggy. The whipped mascarpone on top was a nice touch. Normally tiramisu is layers of mascarpone and ladyfingers alternating but Machiavelli does it differently and I like how there is less cream than usual.
This is a solid place and service was good so we will definitely be back but skipping the carbonara."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Dione L.,"Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Carol B.,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Victoria H.,"Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nita L.,"TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Michael G.,"Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenn N.,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Tom B.,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Elizabeth K.,"I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Sou M.,"My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Pinky P.,"This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Karrissa D.,"I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Andrea O.,"I'm Italian and I'm very picky and demanding when it comes to Italian food (or food in general for that matter). Well Due is among my favorite places to get real genuine Italian food. Everything is good and authentic, my favs these days are the pasta cacio e pepe with guanciale and Tiramisù. This is a must try, it will become one of your favorites too"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Becca H.,"Due' Cucina is a great spot for lunch or dinner! The prices are great, the servers and atmosphere are relaxed and welcoming, and the food is amazing. My go-to order is the Traditional Bolognese Ragu with traditional spaghetti. My boyfriend orders the Aglio & Olio with healthy campanelle and adds fried tofu. Be sure to get tiramisu, sharing is an option size-wise, but you won't want to. It's to die for! We placed an order for pick-up today since the city is still under the stay-at-home order. There was no fuss and no wait to get our food. We're going to continue supporting Dué through the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Yum!!!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen H.,"Thank goodness this place delivers all the way to Kirkland! I miss eating out in Seattle so I was super thankful and appreciative that we were in the delivery area.
I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on. Highly recommend!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Richard U.,"3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Holly L.,"Hi Holly,
We are glad you like the food. I am sorry that GrubHub took so long to deliver your food. I reviewed your order: your food was ready after 9 minutes the order was placed, and then was picked up by the driver about 10 minutes later. Although the service GrubHub provided is terrible we are not responsible for it as we have no control on the delivery and I would like to ask you to not penalize us. I suggest you to contact GrubHub customer service and ask for compensation.
Let me know if I can further help you."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Marie B.,"I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Theresa L.,Ordered from here for the first time last night. Had delivered and dropped at the front door. Everything was timely manor and tasted great! Can't wait to try more
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Julia L.,"Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Pauli D.,"Who knew such a cute little pasta shop could be found in cap hill? The sauces are pretty light and the noodles are cooked just enough to still have that bite where it sticks to your teeth. You won't feel heavy with cheese or sleepy from too many carbs. You order first then pick up your food in the back from the kitchen. It's bus yourself when you are finished here, they have water in the back and utensils available on the table.
The tiramisu is also very very nice and I usually don't even like tiramisu so a round of applause for that. We need to come back and try more dishes because for the low price you get a great amount of food."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Edward A.,"Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Yvonne Yiyao X.,"Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Cristina G.,"I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Brianna F.,"Thanks Brianna for your lovely review. It was a pleasure to host you and your friends!
See you next time,

Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Derek H.,"AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Monica L.,"I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Tracy C.,"Hi Traci,
I am sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience in our restaurant. We pride ourself of good friendly service and quality food.
I wish you told us about the issue with your food when you were at the restaurant, our staff is trained to resolve the issue timely and be sure that everyone that leave our premise will have a positive experience.
If you are interested in giving us another shot, I'd love to host you again at Due' for a complimentary meal, and in that occasion hopefully also collect more feedback from you. Just send me an email to info@duecucina.com and we can get it arranged.
Thanks again for your time and valuable feedback!

Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen L.,"Hi Jen,
Firstly, my apologies for getting back to you on this review so late! It has been an incredibly busy month, add some travels in the mix... and somehow we missed your review :(
My second apology is for the inconvenience you encountered during your meal with us.
With regards to your comment on pasta temp: I understand your frustration. We use a plate and bowl warmer exactly to avoid issues like this, however last month the equipment broke and we had a few days of gap before we received the new unit from the manufacturer. We tried our best to ensure customers would not perceive the difference, and luckily we didn't get complains during that time, however it looks like your order was affected.
With regards to salmon: it's hard for me to judge from the pic, however our salmon pasta comes with a scoop of salmon meat on top. If you didn't receive it, it was probably a mistake committed by our plater.
I am glad to offer you a refund on your pasta dishes to compensate you for the bad experience, or alternatively a free meal on us to give us another shot! Please let me know if you are interested in any of these options and we'll get it done asap!
Thank you for your kind feedback, looking forward to hearing back from you soon!
Filippo"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Melody Y.,"Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,chara c.,"Hi Chara,
We are sorry to hear that you did not have a great experience in our restaurant. We pride ourself with the quality of our pasta above everything else. We are a counter spot casual restaurant and we are sorry to hear that you had different expectation. For what concern the ""bite"" let me point out that you had the campanelle (rated 2/5 on our aldentness scale and the bucatini that is hollow inside, so it has intrinsically less bite). If the sauce was too salty that might have been a mistake, however on the cheese side we use a Pecorino Romano of the finest quality to balance the sweetness of the sauce and recreate the authenticity and peasant origin of the dish, but I understand that could be too strong for some. I believe that our food is much better than what you experience today and I would like to invite you for a complimentary meal, a good occasion for us to gather more feedback and hopefully win you back.
Sincerely
Filippo"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Phil G.,"A week ago, we were told Tavolata wouldn't do take out. I phoned tonight, 3/13/2020, and sure enough, Tavolàta was happy to have us pick up food. We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavolàta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavolàta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked. Prices were Seattle high - $100 for this meal. Expensive, but there isn't much choice in the Emerald City. This is not an egalitarian city anymore."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Brian B.,Great service! Great food! Definitely Italy recommend the knoche! My wife and I will definitely be back
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Maia R.,"Terribly disappointing experience, and had it not been for our waitress, this would be one star. I had made our reservations the day Valentine's Day reservations opened and the menu posted at Tavolata. Despite our early booking, we were seated in the very center of a communal table (that, as I recall, I had specifically requested to avoid). The table was too loud for me and my boyfriend to even speak to each other, so we requested to be moved to another table. Meanwhile there were several other couples at their own tables, including one couple at a 4-top. They sat us at the bar, which was fine.
Once we were seated at the bar, we reviewed the menu. The menu in our hands had almost entirely different courses for the pasta and entree from what Tavolata had posted online and the menu we had so been looking forward to. This was incredibly disappointing and deceptive in my opinion.
Our waitress at the bar was lovely (blonde curly hair and tall). But the servers left dirty plates on our spot for too long (I had to ask them to clear the appetizer plates) and they did not seem appropriately trained. I overheard one server saying it was his third day at the job, and the hosts (we were sitting directly next to them) were cursing and mocking some of the patrons to each other by the end of our dinner.
Also, our ticket for our 2nd and 3rd courses ""got lost."" We waited over 1.5 hours for our pasta course after getting the appetizers. When our waitress told us this, she was apologetic but didn't offer any recourse until I asked her if we could have more wine since we had drank the glass that was supposed to be paired with our course. She was happy to oblige but it was pretty clear all we would have gotten was an apology otherwise. When we finally got our pasta, it was cold.
The food was okay. Porchetta was way too salty with huge salt crystals and peppercorns intact that made a difficult texture to chew. If they had had their promised menu I would have ordered the lobster (by the way, Tavolata, don't promise this as a menu item if you aren't positive you'll get it. We had thought about going to the lobster dinner at Derby but didn't because we saw we would get lobster on this menu. What a waste.) Mushroom ravioli was okay but not what I was looking forward to going into the meal. Port wine pairing was cheap and too sweet. 2.5 hours later we left our meal feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
I've had quite a few experiences with Tavolata before this, but after being so disappointed with this deceptive and uncomfortable experience, I will never be returning."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Zachary H.,"My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Kamara S.,"Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Heather W.,"Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Michelle A.,Happy hour at Tavolàta is great ! Be warned... you'll need to be first in line with your whole party in order to be seated. The pasta is pretty good. What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken). Overall I've come here a couple of times and will continue to do so.
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,David H.,"I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Madison S.,"This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Naveed N.,"Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Tara D.,"Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Rebecca W.,"This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Elly L.,"We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Joel Y.,"Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Emily H.,"Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Marina K.,Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sarah N.,"We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Ellen C.,"I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Julia P.,"LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sachi E.,"fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,E. R.,"I am in Seattle to help at UWMC as a Respiratory Therapist. I have been really delighted by my experience here over the last few weeks, which has been made even better with places like this. I ordered a Caesar salad and gnocchi to take with me on my overnight shift. When I stopped to pick up my order (wearing scrubs since I was on my way to work), I was handed my food and my ticket was ripped up. I was really overwhelmed! I have been trying to help local businesses by ordering out as much as possible, but to be recognized for helping during the pandemic is appreciated immensely. The best part? The food was wonderful! Thank you so much, Bizzarro! I will be back and my tip will reflect my gratitude."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Sabryna M.,"A hard five stars for this quirky and authentic Italian restaurant! The first and most notable feature is their magnificent decoration! Bikes hang from the ceiling, ""Big eyes"" paintings with a Wes Anderson narrator on a old time stereo greet you in the bathroom, with many other alluring Knick knacks in every corner.
Not only is the ambiance to die for, BUT THE FOOD! Hand rolled pastas with many other on season dishes for a super reasonable price. They have a famous tomato based sauce that is a must taste (My fave thing on their menu is the ""Margarita"" pasta dish)
Y'all, if you live in/ visit Seattle you literally have to go to this place. If you didn't, that'd be super BIZARRE of you"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Michelle L.,"Oh mine!!!
The place just threw me off completely!
Very small tiny restaurant with corky cute interesting decor.
We got here early around 5:30pm and it was almost full, we took the last 2 seater on the place.
As always, my husband came super prepared, read all the Yelpies' reviews, so he knows what he wants. On the other hand, I just walked in with no clue, so every pasta dish seems yummm.
Our server recommended me to try the Forest Floor Frenzy which is a wild mushroom & walnut parpadelle with cream sherry sauce. This is the most amazing pasta dish I ever have, not exaggerating!! The cream sherry sauce was in a perfect rich creamy consistency coating the think smooth parpadelle. The wild mushrooms had hint of woodiness that might be the sherry sauce amplified must better, and along with the slight crunch of chopped walnuts. I was mmm-ing through every bite.
Then I swapped with my husband's order, the Elk Bolognese. He didn't seem to be too excited about it, but when he passed me his dish, and I took a swift, the aroma captivated me already. The rich sweet peppery smell was making me drool! The elk was pretty lean and not gamey, so blended right in with the pork shoulder. The parpadelle was just the right chew and thinness, amazing!!
I tried the dessert of the day, chevre cheesecake with rosemary graham crust & vanilla olive oil roasted grapes & a black vanilla tea honey sauce. Yeah, you heard me, chevre cheesecake!! It was definitely heavenly! I never had a goat cheesecake before, and I have to say, I'm never a big fan of goat cheese, but I just cannot stop nodding my head and squinting my chinese eyes and giggle! This cheesecake was so delicious!! The goat cheese was on the mild side with some lemon zest or lemon juice blended in that popped in my mouth. I was super happy with the vanilla live oil roasted grapes, taste exactly what it sound, amazingly delicious! It's rare to see olive oil used in dessert so I was very intrigued. Lastly, the black vanilla tea honey sauce had some depth from the tea aroma which blended the cheesecake and rosemary graham crust very well. BEST GOAT CHEESECAKE ever! Even though it was my first
When we left shortly after 6pm, there were at least 3-4 parties waiting outside the restaurant, so do try to come early! Free street parking in the neighborhood, just to make sure not to block someone's driveway
I am still super stoked and savoring all the tastes from this amazing dinner! Already thinking when I can come back!!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Erin M.,"We're headed back tonight so I guess I should get around to reviewing our last experience!
We arrived around 8 on a Weeknight and I had had a terrible day, it was pouring, we were freezing and tired, and Italian was calling our name.
Welcomed at the front door, they led us back to the ""Best Table in the House"" - a tiny, candlelit table tucked into a little alcove in the back of the restaurant, where the glass table top covers hundreds of little notes left on the back of dinner receipts from others who have sat here.
We always start with Arancini - these are creamy and just the right bit of a bite, crispy and nestled in a little bath of Bizzaro's delicious marinara.
I order the Meatballs, available only on Monday nights. He orders the special - Gnocchi with Italian sausage.
The server is the same woman who has waited on us our last 5 times here - I wish I knew her name so I could give her the recognition she deserves. She's funny, so friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We love her!
Food arrives - gnocchi is pillowy and rich, slightly chewy, drenched in a delicious, creamy, herb filled cream sauce. The meatballs are tucked into a perfectly cooked pile of pasta - not spaghetti, but a shorter, thicker, rolled tube noodle covered in light and garlicky marinara, and swaddled in a blanket of melted cheese.
We are far enough away from other tables that we
can enjoy the bits of their conversation that we hear, but we are private enough to enjoy our own.
For dessert, we had gelato that came with some pretty cute little friends on top - that I didn't even mind beheading to scoop up a bit of melted gelato.
Bottom line - we didn't need romance but it's impossible not to get swept up in it if you're here with someone you love. We didn't need for anything while we were there because the service is excellent. And we didn't need two boxes for leftovers because the boyfriend ate his whole plate clean.
Please go here. Please keep this place alive. Bizzaros is a gem that should be shined!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Marissa K.,"Even in this crazy time, the amazing humans at Bizzarro went above and beyond to make a birthday special. And, of course, the food was incredible. Every experience with Bizzarro is better than the last. Thank you!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica M.,"The food didn't match the hype for us, but the service was exceptional.
3 stars for the food and 5 for the service so we'll leave it a 4 overall.
Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.
The pasta itself was just ok - I really wished I had liked it more given all the raving reviews. I'm tempted to come back here to try some of the other pasta dishes though."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Patrick C.,"This is the cutest cafe with lots of little bits and baubles everywhere. The place is always busy and usually requires a wait. After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope. I think for the money Zouave over on 65th is much, and less insanely crowded."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Safina H.,Ordered twice now via caviar. SO TASTY! I'm sad I haven't yet visited the restaurant.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Linda L.,"Came here for dinner and the experience absolutely blew my mind. The environment is quirky and unique, and the service is excellent. The food though - - WOW. We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.
If you come after 5:30 you can expect a wait. Definitely will be a wait if you come after 6"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Regina X.,"Snap pea carbonara had the right flavors with the heavy cheesiness cut by the crispy snap peas and pancetta. The linguini, however, was overcooked and a sad lump hard to separate. For appetizer, the Arancini rice balls were heavy and cheesy but made for a nicely textured dish. Love the outlandish decor and would be back for more pasta."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Alex O.,"I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Brittini C.,"So we ordered take out from here this weekend and was a little disappointed. 1) Their ""small salad "" for 10 bucks is nothing more than about three pieces of lettuce and one strip of carrot - definitely NOT worth it. 2) They completely forgot adding the chicken on one of our pastas which was an extra charge 3) They packaged the other pasta horribly and the sauce spilled completely in the bag. What was left was thin and insubstantial- for a 20 dollar pasta dish I expected ALOT more. 4) I will say, their chicken dish was AMAZING. Almost worth overlooking their shortcomings. Almost. Unfortunately there is far too many good restaurants bringing their A game to consider being a repeat customer."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,SonyA C.,"This is my favorite Italian place in Seattle. It has a cozy and interesting ambiance and the food is phenomenal. I especially love the bread and the seasonal dishes. Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica T.,"My family and I were on vacation in Seattle and stopped here for dinner. We all loved the look and feel of the place. Atmosphere is definitely bizzarro.
There was no wait time for a table of 4/weeknight.
Starter salad had a mild, sweet dressing that even our pickiest teenager enjoyed.
Food was really good. Forest Floor Frenzy was creamy and mushroomy heaven.
Lasagna- good
Meatballs-great
Antipasta plate-great
What else about this place? The bathrooms. Weird recording playing in one of them with paintings of big eyed children. Creepy and intriguing."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ra L.,"Amazing house made gluten free pasta, spectacular food all around especially their seasonal dishes, the staff is absolutely amazing, good wine"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Mahsa S.,the restaurant has a great atmosphere with eclectic decor. It's fairly small so expect a long wait. The food was good but a bit expensive for just simple marinara pasta and cheese. The complimentary bread was delicious though
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nishita K.,Highly recommend the tiramisu! Best I have had in a long time. Aranciji was okay. The pastas were delicious. The proportions were great. I had the seasonal pasta 'bombastica'. It was white wine based not too acidic. Very light and flavorful. The elk pasta was hearty and very flavoful. I thought I wouldn't like it because it's elk meat but I would definitely get it for myself next time. Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions. They served us some bread while we waited for our food. We waited for about 30/35 mins on a Friday night to get a table for 4.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Tayler H.,"Bizzaros is a kooky and perfect little Italian hole-in-the-wall! I 10/10 recommend eating here. It's easy to access right off the I-5 freeway, and is in a very cute and ""old"" restaurant row.
The restaurant itself is very homey, with ""bizzare"" decor. Loved the romantic/fun lighting. Our waitress was very nice.
The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ray M.,"This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nita L.,"Most aptly named, this place is a Bizarre combination of Romantic yet Eclectic.
Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Juanita K.,Thank you so much for your support. We look forward to being open again !!!
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Piko L.,"""I'm so full but I must keep eating"" is the motto you leave with after dining here!
Everything here is delicious-- from their bruschetta to their seafood pastas, their pizzas and calzones, nothing disappoints. It's ALL good!
The place is great for dates or groups, and the cute orange walls really set the mood.
I can't wait to come back in the daytime for outside seating so I can get a good photo of this delicious pasta!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Valerie S.,"Delicious Italian food!
We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Judy M.,"Tbh we were supposed to trot over to the Pink Door on this night, but we were just too tired to haul everyone back to that area. Yelpers guided us to this spot. We were only a hop and a skip away from this great neighborhood Italian Restaurant! Amongst the dishes we had ordered were the Frutti di mare (seafood pasta), Bolognese, and carbonara. The seafood was cooked perfectly, not overcooked (say no to rubbery seafood!), bolognese had lots of flavor, and carbonara was good. Overall it was satisfying. Our service was excellent, really helped the experience overall.
Although this wouldn't be a designation restaurant, I would still recommend it if you are nearby, and got a hankering for Italian food."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Nancy S.,"The food and service here is just amazing!!! Came here with a friend on the recommendation of another good friend and I have no regrets!
I ordered their seafood spaghetti and was not disappointed- it had sooooooooooo much delish seafood on it!!! The portioning is very generous and the quality exceptional... can't wait to come here again!!!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Lana P.,"Super disappointing. Deserving good reviews brought us here for dinner.
Service sucks and don't mind little fruit flies all over your food. Food was very so so and I could not get out there fast enough to get away from those flies and dirty walls."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Rpisces G.,"First time at this local restaurant, food and service were both really good, will definitely be back. Had the lasagna which was very meaty, delicious."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Abhinav S.,"Had a crave for Italian food, and wanted to try out a new place. So this brought me to La Vita.
Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,D C.,"This is our favorite local Italian place. They have a great menu and we love their specials. The prices are very reasonable, especially for Seattle. We come here so often that many of the staff know who we are and will drop by our table to say hello. We brought our relatives from Italy here for dinner one night and they loved it. The owner,Giuseppe made them feel at home speaking in Italian and bringing all of our dishes family style. Perfect ending to their American vacation :-)"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Francesco L.,I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and this place never disappoints. Great hours and great food. If your looking for some great Italian food in Downtown Seattle this place is a must
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Fraser C.,"I have been dining here a few times a year for over 10 years. The food is AMAZING and the service is great. Some of the best pasta in town!
The quality of food is very high and prices are reasonable."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Sharon C.,"Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Stephanie L.,"I had the cannelloni. You read that correctly- that is not cannoli! Think enchiladas but Italian! The big noodles were smothered in bolognese and cheese. Every bite was heaven. The portion is great if you're really hungry. Otherwise lucky you, leftovers for lunch! This is one of the most amazing Italian dishes I've ever had. The atmosphere here is lively as well. I can't wait to go back. I'll try to get something different but something tells me I'll be getting the cannelloni again :)."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Kayla K.,Hi I am so sorry for your experience and very contrary to how we want things to be run for sure. We would love to welcome you back of course on us if you be willing to give us another try. In the meantime if you could describe your server to me that would be most helpful because I certainly will be following up. Thank you for posting a review so that this could be brought to our attention.
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Joan S.,"I went on an excursion today with my dog and walk down second Avenue just to see what was down there and I went to this restaurant the food was amazing they allowed me to bring my dog in and sit at a table I had the biggest Caesar salad I've ever had in my whole life and the lasagna was enough for two people extremely fresh and they gave me garlic bread and a whole meal was $24. Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,
You might also meet Giuseppe Forte the owner"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Maddie E.,"We discovered this place on Postmates and keep coming back for more. If you're looking for pasta, the carbonara is a MUST get. It's incredible. Their bread and salads are mediocre but I strictly come here for carbonara."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Douglas W.,"Amazing service. They weren't super busy but seemed to be under staffed. Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Crystal F.,"Hi, is that what Grubhub told you? Because that is not the case. If you are not satisfied with the dish we are more than happy to refund you. I’ve been making that carbonara recipe for the last 20 years, my only thought is perhaps for delivery may not be the best option, but if you’re not satisfied I’m more than happy to try to make you satisfied. We do not have the power to issue refunds only Grubhub does, so I’m not sure why they wouldn’t just refund you. Let me know if you were able to get it sorted out with them and if not I can try to reach out to them I just need to know some more information from you in order to try to find the order. Again sorry you were not happy"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,JC J.,"Service was great
Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Edward S.,"La Vita E Bella is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Belltown. It has a really old school feel to it. In English, the name translates to Life and Beautiful, which is a good name.
The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Jordan M.,"Exactly the experience I expected from a nice evening out at a nice-looking place such as this.
We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we want and we got a nice little table in the corner by the fire outside. The menu was fairly small, especially for food, which I actually love! The options were quite wonderful and I could've ordered nearly anything on the menu.
We opted to start with ""The Dark Heart"" for the cocktail and a glass of wine. Both were excellent. Our appetizer was three little fried risotto and cheese balls that were delicious!
For a main course we got the pasta with Wild Boar Ragu and goat cheese along with the Pesto Risotto topped with New York Steak. $14 and $18 respectively. Great value at such a place like this.
For dessert I got a tiramisu which was exactly what you would expect from a high-end tiramisu so it was nothing impressive or unique but it was very good. I could say the same for the crème brûlée. It was your standard crème brûlée but it had a really really nice taste. Everything here was done very well and the evening was wonderful. The two servers that continually took care of us were wonderful as well.
Not only was it a wonderful experience but it was a pretty good value I think. The bill was less than $100. I'll be back!!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Tazeen L.,"Attractive spot in pioneer square with a cozy yet stylish space, good food and reasonable prices... came in Saturday night and while pretty full, was able to grab a table without a wait. Host was very accommodating and service pretty prompt.
Started with the antipasti plate that was veggie heavy, easily shareable, pretty standard fare. Also had the fried stuffed olives that were salty, crunchy, rich... Good but I was done after a couple.
I was craving red meat and carbs (definitely one of those nights) so had the pesto risotto with New York strip steak. Risotto was pretty good- creamy yet still toothsome, nice pesto flavor, garlic chips sprinkled on for nice bursts of crunch and saltiness. The steak missed the spot, portion size was fine especially given the price, but it was served well done. Waiter didn't ask and I didn't think to mention my preference when i ordered, and I didn't send back because I had already started eating the risotto by the time I noticed the meat- so shared culpability but I didn't think anyone served well done steak on purpose anymore :0
Had the tiramisu and that was lovely- creamy yet still light, all the flavors and textures you want in a tiramisu...
Would definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood or maybe for lunch..."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Bernie L.,"This place is, in reality, a 4.5. I can't give them a five because they're not unbelievable, but they're still really really good!
We went there before heading to an event and while the food portions are small the price is reasonable enough you can order a few things. I had the Arancini, which they often run out of. They were fantastic. Though I love a good riceball.
Moving on to the next course I had the Fettucine carbonara. Delicious. Small, but great. Same with the cherry duck confit with polenta. Fruity, delicious, wonderfully cooked.
The tiramisu was also great, though other people I was dining with thought it was too strong.
Service is great, though we were there on a slow night. Still, I get the feeling service is always good.
A hidden gem not too far from the stadiums. I will definitely be back."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Cara L.,"My man and I were looking for a great place without a huge crowd to enjoy some Friday evening cocktails and eats. He mentioned he ran past this beautiful restaurant that reminded him of when he lived in LA and suggested we try it. I wasn't about to argue.
Holy crap--this place is gorgeous. And the outdoor seating, while tiny, is quite cozy. I really appreciated the smallish crowd and the quiet block in Pioneer Square. Because, if I'm being honest, I didn't know what to expect when I heard it had a patio on 1st in Pioneer Square. And, just FYI, this is a randomly quiet block on 1st.
If you're hungry and still want to sit on the patio, don't let the small spaces scare you. Somehow the staff here found space for our waters, cocktails, charcuterie board, steak tartar and my pasta. I'm still not sure how they figured it out.
My cocktail was delicious (Dark Heart) and perfectly balanced. The food was exactly what I was looking for that evening: decedent, freshly prepared with care, smaller portions. Starting with the charcuterie, I was impressed. The meats were plentiful, the olives were my favorite kind, and the cheeses, while super small in portion size, were great choices. I hate it when you order a cheese board and like 2 out of the three are blue cheeses. Bleh. These were varied, hard and salty to a softer, milder cheese--no blues. The steak tartar came out beautifully, and although I didn't try it, the presentation was delicious enough for me. And then my bucatini was perfect. The sausage was spicy and plentiful, the sauce was bright and fresh, and the mild, creamy goat cheese was a welcomed addition to the dish.
The service was thoughtful without being overbearing. No complaints on wait times or anything like that--they were very accommodating.
The prices here can get pretty lofty, but don't let the ""small plate"" thing fool you. These are still great portion sizes. This will definitely be one of our regular date night spots!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Megan R.,"Wow, I loved this place! We came in after a Yelp event and it was perfect because they weren't too busy. I have been trying to eat here for like a year! But they are either always packed or we come on Sunday and they are closed on Sunday.
So this was our lucky day! We sat up at the bar and our bartender was wonderful the whole night.
We started with the anti pasta. It was delish. Full of yummy veggies, some meat, cheese and bread. For entrees we ordered shrimp risotto and carbonara. Both entrees were excellent! The shrimp were wrapped beautifully in prosciutto. The carbonara was just as lovely and my fav out of the two dishes but not by much b/c they were both so good!
The ambience in here is beautiful and sexy. It's a great place for a date night or for a more intimate night out with friends.
I love it here b/c it's really reasonably priced, unpretentious service, cool sexy vibes and delicious food. We had such a great night and I can't wait to come back!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Paulina H.,"Randomly found this place and saw the lovely design and decorations, it's so beautiful and arrogant. I went around 2:30pm, so it's not busy. I ordered Carbonara, it tasted bland and a little too much black pepper, egg over cooked so I can't make the yolk leaked. However, I do the taste of this dish, so I would still recommend this. The chop salad with steak is also a good choice, steak is medium rare and cooked perfectly. Everything taste perfectly together, especially with avocado! Highly recommend the salad. I will definitely go back and try other things.
Food: 8/10

Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Sebastian T.,"Upon wanting to explore all the cocktail bars in the Seattle area, Intermezzo Carmine not only offered cocktails but also Italian food. I went with a friend and decided to give it a shot! The space was a bit small, but it had a relaxed upscale vibe. This would be a great spot for ordering just cocktails without food as well. I'd love to come back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor seating area too.
The drinks and the food were at a typical upscale price & portion. I tried a cocktail, the glazed duck confit & the spaghetti Nero.
The cocktails were great, and exactly as i would expect at this price point. No qualms here!
The glazed duck confit as average at best, the cherry glaze didnt seem to compliment the flavor of the duck very well, and parts of the duck was overcooked and dry.
The spaghetti Nero was fantastic, it was an interesting touch to add the smoked salmon, as it was my first time having smoked salmon with the pasta but it strangely complimented the flavors well, the smokiness blended with the tomato & the creaminess seemed to blend right in with the flavors of the pasta.
Overall, it is a bit pricey for what you get, but given that this is finer dining, it was a satisfying experience. I wasn't wow'ed enough to come back again, but i would recommend coming by at least once to check out the space!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Melody L.,"Definitely a cute, intimate place to share a drinks and eat a meal with friends. They don't have a wait list and it's first come, first served. You have to keep an eye out for a table.
Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good. We also ordered an appetizer to share (the risotto balls), which was only okay. The risotto tasted more like thick white rice.
Service was good as well. Great place to check out if you're not too hungry and looking to catch up with friends and/or have an intimate date night!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Bo P.,"Keep in mind this isn't a general rating, but a subjective one based on my experience and dish alone :)
I've been to Intermezzo a handful of times for happy hour, but this was a different experience. Our waiter was incredible. Friendly, attentive, but gave us our time/space to catch up with the friends that we were with. We were waiting for the birthday girl to show up, and he was genuinely patient as he continued to bring out plates of bread to keep us preoccupied.
The fettucini carbonara was honestly perfection to me. The noodles were al dente, there was just the right amount of pancetta, and the poached egg's consistency was just as I wanted.
The waiter (I wish I got his name!) comped a tiramisu on behalf of the birthday girl, and while we told him it was OK, he insisted, and we obliged. And we were so happy that we did. They say it's a delicious 100-year old recipe and it tastes exactly like that. Best tiramisu I've had to date."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Erin J.,"As my friend said ""this place is so civilized."" I'll call it approachable fancy. It was certainly upscale but not intimidating at all. Gorgeous decor that's cozy yet airy at the same time... I could sit there all day.
We had a bottle of white and the kale Caesar with chicken and the fettuccine carbonara. It was all amazingly delicious and I'll likely find my way back next time I'm in town!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Johnny L.,"Intermezzo Carmine
A lot of goat flavor in their arancini when it has parmesan, mozzarella cheeses, wild mushroom filled inside risotto bites.. indeed done perfectly.. but the goat taste overpowers the piece
Chicken Parmesan is very light in flavor.. needs more seasoning (nms)! Bread nicely toasted, great fresh basil n melted cheese.. came w/ a pear salad but I am not here 4 that
Welcoming environment, just needs less goat taste n nms!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Karen Z.,"This place had a very charming ambiance, and the service was excellent. I came here on a Tuesday evening and ordered:
- 1/2 a portion of the green grilled salad (5/5): Super fresh, packed with lots of tasty veggies. Great starter!
- Steak tartare (3/5): This was tasty, but the steak was at times difficult to chew.
- Prawn risotto (5/5): Incredible. The prawns were amazing! They were grilled and wrapped in prosciutto -- very tender and perfectly seasoned. The risotto was very well done as well.
Overall, had a great dining experience but the quality of the steak tartare kept it from being five stars -- wish I'd ordered another dish instead!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Savannah S.,"Love Intermezzo!! Such a solid, cute bar with awesome cocktails and great bartenders!
I've been twice and love it. The pasta is delicious (I mean Carmine's, their formal restaurant is AMAZING) so it's no surprise. The drinks are creative, fun, and use high quality spirits.
The space is beautiful, chic, and one of the many great spots in pioneer square. I love the bartenders- so fun and personable (got free tequila shots last time!)
Highly recommend for a casual meal with good drinks!"
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Shoa J.,"Absolutely horrible experience. I had my birthday here this past weekend and after confirming 3 times over the phone on where we would like to be seated, we didn't get the table we had requested and they put us on a table for 6 when the reservation was for 8 (the server did acknowledge that the reservation clearly called out the specific table we had requested). The way we were now seated, I had one friend just sitting by himself cut off from the rest of us.
Our server was rude and just not mentally present. Our drinks took forever to come, I had to reorder my wine twice since the server was spaced out. They even picked up my pasta before I finished it- by far the worst service I have ever received. All of us agreed that we would never return to this place."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Nupur M.,"Came here for a weekday lunch. Loved the interiors. It wasn't too crowded and we got seating immediately. It did not have many veg options. We ordered the arancini, the fettuccine carbonara without any meat which was good. Loved the poached egg on the top. The arancini was okay did not like it much. Loved the tiramisu. The creme brûlée was good."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Rosa K.,"First of all the ambience and the décor of this place is amazing. It is perfect for a girls night or date night- with wine and cheese (you can't go wrong with the antipasti, salumi and the oysters).
One of my favorites is the fettucine carbonara. I've had the lamb chops and the bone marrow which were really good too. These are all really rich, so make sure to order a drink with it!
The dishes are all pretty small so whenever I come here, we order a couple of dishes so we can try a little of each."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Molly M.,This place was one of our favorites on our trip to Seattle! We just stopped in for a cocktail during a walk (but brunch looked good too). We were attracted to the openness of the restaurant. There was plenty of space to have a private meal and tons of natural light. The cocktails were very unique and super tastey. Not too sweet which I always worry about. The bartender was awesome and gave us plenty of recommendations for Seattle and Portland. I wish I got her name because my boyfriend and I sat and talked with her for over an hour and actually enjoyed it. Highly recommend!
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Amanda C.,"Was quite disappointed with this place. FYI I came for food and not drinks, so can't comment on their cocktails. I thought the squid ink pasta was very average, the pasta was cooked longer than al dente, and the portions were small. Flavors were there though. The arancini that my friends and I shared was also just okay. The risotto inside was really bland, and I could not really taste the mushrooms."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Rian F.,"Great food, smaller selection than their parent restaurant. Had dessert and drinks. The creme brûlée was awesome! My wife liked the tiramisu as well. Only thing is that the place is a little loud."
Intermezzo Carmine,(206) 596-8940,Arash D.,"I have to say, I came in here at he worst possible time but this review is a reflection of how a situation was handled, not of the
food.
My fiancé and I walk in and are standing in the middle of the floor for a good 5 minutes, with a couple of waiters even walking past us, without being greeted or told where to be seated. We sat at the table with our waters for another 10 minutes and then we notice that the lights turn off. After sitting there again for another 5 minutes, an employee finally comes and tells us they blew their power for the second time that day and will likely be back up in 10 minutes.
Fine. Happens. Totally get it. ""While we sit and wait for the power could we get two glasses of wine please? ""
"" unfortunately I can't take any orders since I can't track them""
"" it is only two glasses of wine, I don't think we will lose track""
"" unfortunately we have to sit tight until the power is back""
... ok...
Write it down maybe? You only have like 6 red wines on the menu. Wouldn't be that hard to keep track.
After 20 minutes, he comes back and says a technician has to come out, is on the way, but it will be a long time. He welcomed us to go to their sister restaurant next door that is double the price. Lol
My first thought was they are worried they wouldn't be able to charge the cards. 1) I had cash 2)you can use your sister restaurants card system(it looked like they were already doing this) 3) Your power went out after we sat there waiting for 20 minutes. If I came in for a glass of wine, any decent waiter or host would offer it complementary as an apology for the situation.
Killed our buzz of being excited to try the place. Left bummed."
